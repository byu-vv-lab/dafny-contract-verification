\title{Software Contract Quality}

\begin{abstract}

Software contracts, or specifications, define the intended behavior of systems. They are often used to check
conformance and correctness of implementations, and therefore must be correct if they are to be used effectively.
\egm{Would it be better to use the term \emph{safe substitution}? So contracts are a declarative statement of computation and tools such as Dafny prove that an implementation is a safe substitution for the contract? Safe substitution would need to be defined informally.}
Writing contracts is error-prone and there are few tools for their debugging. This proposal presents three common
pitfalls in software contracts and describes a plan to detect those pitfalls.
\egm{I might suggest that the three common pitfalls be stated here intuitively.}
It also outlines the
blueprint for a tool built for the Dafny programming language that would detect and mitigate the pitfalls. The ideas
and algorithms presented can be extended to other contract-based languages.
\egm{Give an intuitive definition of Dafny (same for other terms). The introduction can give a proper definition of each of the concepts mentioned in the abstract.}

\section{Introduction}

There is a growing importance of specifications in high-assurance systems – knowing what should be happening
in the system versus what is actually happening is crucial, with the obvious goal being agreement
between the two. Specification-aware languages such as Dafny \cite{dafny} and <<>> are also becoming more prevalent in
software engineering, both for contract-driven development and for increasing confidence in existing systems.

Specifications, or software contracts, are used to describe the intended behavior of a program. They are used
to specify both the inputs and outputs of a system in the form of preconditions and postconditions. Preconditions
describe the required state of the system at the beginning of a method as well as the domain of the inputs,
while postconditions describe the state of the system after the method has executed. Software contracts
are used by languages such as Dafny to verify that implementations match their intended behavior, by proving
that a program’s contract and implementation agree.
\egm{I might suggest using \emph{safe substitution} above since Dafny proves an implementation is a safe substitution for a contract. It follows the Liskov principle---all need to be defined.}
However, a proof of this form can be misleading - though
one can be sure that the implementation adheres to the contract, there is no guarantee that the contract itself
is without defects.

Writing correct contracts can be as error prone as writing correct implementations, so a proof of adherence
between the two can be meaningless if there are issues in the specification. There are many common pitfalls
that can easily go undetected, and the consequences of these pitfalls can often completely void the utility of
a contract. Even worse, a bad contract gone undetected can create a false sense of confidence in a system,
because contracts are often tied to proofs. Though a system “proves out”, it only proves out relative to the
specifications. Faulty specifications lead to implementations that do not have the intended behavior, so developers 
need to be extremely confident that the former are correct. 

This work will focus on mitigating three common pitfalls of software contracts: inconsistency, unconstrained
outputs, and redundancy. A contract is consistent if all of its components are realizable, meaning that the contract
does not contain contradicting requirements. Left unchecked, inconsistencies can make a contract impossible to satisfy
or cause properties to be vacuously true, as a false premise always leads to a true conclusion. Outputs are
unconstrained when it is possible, given certain inputs, to end up with outputs that are in a domain that is not specified.
The implications of an unconstrained output can be large - it means that there is a section of an output that is
completely irrelevant in verification. Finally, A contract is redundant when there are unnecessary components. Contracts
with redundancy can become convoluted, making them more difficult to read and understand, and therefore more
error-prone.

We propose an implementation-agnostic SMT-based solution to the three mentioned pitfalls. The solution is implementation-agnostic in the sense
that there is no reliance on any associated implementation to analyze a contract. The idea of "design by contract" \cite{meyer1992applying} is that the 
ideal way to create a software system is to first understand {\it what} it will do, and then figure out {\it how} to do it. Writing a contract and 
any appropriate proofs is the first step, implementing the intent of the contract follows. This practice allows designers reason in the abstract 
before working out how the actual computation takes place, as the properties and key components of the system are known prior to implementation. 
Verifying contracts independently of any implementation keeps specification and implementation issues separate. 

\section{Problem}

This work will provide a means of checking the quality of logical software contracts in order to increase assurance
that implementations and proofs of agreement between contracts and implementations are correct. It will focus on
examining the contracts independently of their corresponding implementations, and by doing so will allow developers
to have a sanity check that does not require a model or implementation to be available. Logical contracts will be
checked for three main pitfalls - inconsistency, unconstrained outputs, and redundancy. The contract quality checker
will be built for the Dafny programming language, but the ideas presented are easily extendable to other languages
and frameworks that use software contracts.
\egm{Other frameworks and languages should be a part of the related work. These may also be mentioned in the introduction.}

\section{Related Work}

Creating correct software contracts is a well-known issue \cite{rozier2016specification} \cite{kupferman2006sanity}.
Barnat et al. \cite{barnat2012checking} \cite{barnat2016analysing} proposed a method for checking contract quality using model checking,
both for contracts with associated models and for standalone contracts. The work done for model-free sanity checking is
similar to the goals of this thesis, though that method transforms LTL to automata, rather than using an SMT solver. The approach
has the inherent limitation that transforming LTL formulas into models can become complex for large systems.

Filipovikj et al. \cite{filipovikj2017smt} propose a procedure that uses Z3 \cite{de2008z3} to check software contracts
for inconsistencies. This procedure is different from ours because it is intended for contracts that are written in
natural language, as opposed to formal contracts used in verification languages. Much of the work is to translate
natural language to constraints that can be passed to Z3. Their tool does not check contracts
for unconstrained output or redundancy. 

Redundancy has been studied through the lens of logic minimization... (add related work about this)
\egm{The notion of redundancy is actually really interesting. I wonder if it might be wise to read some of the related work is logic minimization? That is used a bunch in hardware design to simplify complex predicates. Binary decision diagrams were used extensively to minimize logic for sometime. Anyways, logic minimization may be just what is needed for redundancy, and it would be some more related work.}

Work has been done to determine when components of a system are sufficiently covered. Jaffe et al. \cite{jaffe1989completeness}
looked at different definitions of contract coverage, especially in a black-box environment. Their work asserts that "completeness"
with respect to outputs in a contract means that each output must be fully specified. This work will use this definition of
completeness to check for unconstrained outputs.

\section{Inconsistency}

A contract is inconsistent if there are assertions or requirements that contradict one another. More formally, a
contract \(\Phi\) is made up of specification clauses \(\Phi = \{\varphi_{1}, \varphi_{2}, ..., \varphi_{n}\}\).
A specification clause is made up of logical expressions. A contract is consistent if there exists a way to satisfy
\(\varphi_{1} \land \varphi_{2} \land ... \land \varphi_{n} \). Conversely, a contract is a contradiction
if \(\varphi_{1} \land \varphi_{2} \land ... \land \varphi_{n} \implies false\).

Inconsistent assertions about the post-state of a program can never be met by the associated implementation.
This may seem unimportant, as an SMT solver will detect the mismatch between the contract and the implementation
and report an error. However, the only knowledge the programmer comes away with is that the contract and the
implementation do not agree. They are none the wiser about what is causing the issue – is it an issue
with their implementation, their contract or both?
\egm{Didn't we show that Dafny can prove anything about the post-state of a method in the presesnce of a post-condition that is a contradiction?}

Inconsistent requirements are arguably even more dangerous. An inconsistent requirement boils down to requiring
 \(false\). With a false pretense, any assertion can be proven to be vacuously true. This is the tricky case
 where an an SMT solver will not catch the issue, because \(false \implies true\) is valid logically. The implementation
 will appear to prove out with no issue whatsoever. This issue also arises in assertions that include implications: if
 an implication reduces to false on the left hand side, the right hand side is meaningless. It is worth noting that when 
 a precondition to a method is a contradiction, then the method cannot be called in any context because the precondition is 
 always violated, which can be a teller that something is amiss. However, if the requirement is the left side of an 
 implication in a postcondition, there is no obvious alarm.

\subsection*{Example: inconsistent assertions}

In the following example, it is quite simple to see the inconsistency of the assertions. When systems are large and more
convoluted, inconsistencies can be more difficult to spot. The simpleness of the example is to get to the heart of the matter.

\begin{lstlisting}

method inconsistent(a : bool, b : bool) returns (result : bool)
    requires a && b
    ensures a ==> b
    ensures a && !b

\end{lstlisting}

We are trying to ensure that \(b\) is both true and untrue. This is a contradiction. All clauses must be satisfiable
at the same time for a contract to be consistent. As stated previously, with an implementation attached to this contract,
Dafny would catch the issue and report that the implementation does not agree with the contract. What Dafny would not
tell the developer is that the implementation can {\it never} satisfy the specification. In systems with complicated
contracts, a developer could spend time trying to fix an implementation that has no hope of satisfying an inconsistent
contract.
\egm{The premise is that this analysis is agnostic to the implementation, so when discussing examples, it might be wise to differentiate between implementing the contract and using the contract in a calling context. For example, if I use a method with a contract with a contradiction, either the pre-condition is always violated or Dafny can prove anything about the post-state. That is the observed consequence of contradictions. Maybe make that more clear in the example and text? Also, maybe move the example the beginning of the subsection?}

\subsection*{Example: inconsistent requirements}

Consider the following example:

\begin{lstlisting}

method BinarySearch(a: array<int>, key: int) returns (index: int)
    requires forall i, j | 0 <= i < a.Length && 0 <= j < a.Length
        :: i <= j ==> a[i] < a[j]
    ensures 0 <= index < a.Length ==> a[index] == key
    ensures index < 0 ==> forall k :: 0 <= k < a.Length ==> a[k] != key

\end{lstlisting}

The \(requires\) clause above has an error. The intent of the clause is to require a sorted array \(a\) as input.
However, the claim that \(i <= j \implies a[i] < a[j]\) is false. If the indeces are the same, then \(a\) at that
index has to be the same. Because the relationship between requires and ensures is an implication, this false requirement
makes any ensures clause provable. Dafny currenly will not catch this error, with or without an implementation attached to
the contract.
\egm{Swap the examples so they match their introduction order earlier in the sub-section with contradictions in the pre-conditions first. Make clear the two consequences of a contradiction: pre-condition is always violated in any calling context or anything can be proved about the post-state also in any calling context.}

\section{Unconstrained outputs}

\egm{Here the issue is framed in the context of an implementation, but the idea is to be agnostic to that implementation. Maybe consider just showing the contract? In cases such as the condractions, the issue is only discovered in the context if an implementation, so it that case, it some implementation code may make sense, but otherwise, focus on the contracts?}
When writing a contract, the whole point is to be able to talk about the behavior of the system being specified.
Every system has inputs (whether implicit or explicit) and outputs, and specifications tell us what these pieces need
to look like. Let’s look at the idea of unconstrained outputs with an example:

\begin{lstlisting}

method absolute_value(n : int) returns (result : int)
    ensures n < 0 ==> result == -1 * n
{
    if (n < 0) {
        return -1 * n;
    } else {
        return n;
    }
}

\end{lstlisting}

We can easily see that this implementation of a method that returns the absolute value of an integer is correct. A developer may be
tempted to only ensure something about the case that changes the value of \(n\). However, in the case that \(n >= 0\), the value
of \(result\) is totally unconstrained. If we changed the implementation to return a hard-coded value for that case, everything
would still prove out:

\begin{lstlisting}

method absolute_value(n : int) returns (result : int)
    ensures n < 0 ==> result == -1 * n
{
    if (n < 0) {
        return -1 * n;
    } else {
        return 142;
    }
}

\end{lstlisting}

Not accounting for every possible value of outputs causes portions of an implementation to not affect verification at all. In
most cases, it is important to understand the conditions lead to all possible outputs. This is another case where a
developer could be led to believe that an implementation that proves out is correct, when in reality, the specification is
simply not strong enough.

\section{Redundancy}

A software contract is redundant if there are unnecessary components in it. More formally, given a contract
\(\Phi = \{\varphi_{1}, \varphi_{2}, ..., \varphi_{n}\}\), if \(\{\varphi_{2} \land ... \land \varphi_{n}\} \implies \varphi_{1}\), then
\(varphi_{1}\) is redundant - it is already implied by the other formulae!

While redundancy does not cause direct errors, it can lead to convoluted specifications that are more error prone. Specifications should be as
clear and simple as possible, so the removal of redundant properties allows for more streamlined specifications and takes away some chance
for misunderstanding or error.

Consider the following example:

\begin{lstlisting}

method redundant(x : int) returns (result : int)
    requires 0 <= x < 100
    requires x != -1 && x != 50

\end{lstlisting}

In this simple example, we can see that the developer wants to specify that the input must be between 0 and 100, and cannot be
-1 or 50. The \(x \neq -1\) is redundant. \(0 \leq x < 100 \implies x \neq -1\) already.

\section{Approach}

We will use the Z3 SMT solver as the main tool for detecting each above pitfall. As previosly stated,
this work will be implemented for Dafny, but the techniques used could easily be used elsewhere.

\subsection*{Detecting contradictions}
\egm{I now wonder if we should change inconsitencies to contradictions and use the term contradiction every where? Thoughts?}

Detecting inconsistencies in specifications is as simple as determining whether the contract as a whole is satisfiable.
We need only to take the conjunction of each subformula, and ask Z3 if there is a satifying assignment. If Z3 tells us that the
formula is unsatisfiable, we know that we have an inconsistency. However, we want more information than just that. We
want to know what parts of the contract are inconsistent with other parts. This set of inconsistent formulas could be
nontrivial, as there could exisit multiple subformulas that do not agree with other subformulas. We want to report all
such combinations to the developer.

In order to acheive this, we draw from Barnat's \cite{barnat2016analysing} work on inconsistency detection.
To find the combinations of consistent formulae and the combinations of inconsistent formulae in a contract
\(\Phi = \{\varphi_{1}, \varphi_{2}, ..., \varphi_{n}\}\), we start with the set \(\{\varphi_{1} \land \varphi_{2} \land ... \land \varphi_{n}\} \)
and the sets that contain each individual formula: \(\{\varphi_{1}\}, \{\varphi_{2}\}, ... \{\varphi_{n}\} \), and check
the consistency of each set. If any of the individual formulae are inconsistent alone, then \(\Phi\) will also be inconsistent.
We then go through a processes of removing formulae from \(\Phi\), and adding formulae to consistent individual sets.

We will also check for inconsistency in clauses that have implications, to discover any vacuity in requirements.
\egm{There should be some related work with what is called an \emph{unsat core} from the SMT literature. The issue is that when an SMT solver says there is not satisfying assignment, people want proof that such is really the case as it would be down to a defect in the SMT solver implementation. The unsat core is a proof certificate that the problem truly cannot be satisfied. It may be worth looking at some of the work with unsat cores.} 

\subsection*{Detecting unconstrained output}

Unconstrained output has to do with the domain of the output variables of a method. If a contract describes the entire
domain of the variable at hand, then every possible value of that variable is accounted for. The process of detecting
unconstrained output can also be accomplished by using an SMT solver. Jaffe et al. \cite{jaffe1989completeness} discuss how
an output is "complete", or in our terms, constrained, if the disjunction of all final assertions about that output is a
tautology. For example, if there is a clause that ensures that given a certain condition, the output \(x < 5\), in order
for {\it x} to be fully constrained, we would need a condition, or set of conditions, that ensure that the output \(x \geq 5\).
Thus \(x < 5 \lor x \geq 5\), which always evaluates to true.

Our approach for detecting unconstrained outputs will be based on this insight:
\break

\begin{algorithmic}

\ForAll{$o \in \mathcal Outputs $}
    \State $relevantClauses \gets c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ \Comment{Relevant clauses are those that mention o}
    \If{$c_{1} \lor c_{2} \lor ... \lor c_{n}$ is true}
        \State $result \gets constrained$
    \Else
        \State $result \gets unconstrained$
    \EndIf
\EndFor

\end{algorithmic}

Sending the disjunction of the relevant clauses to Z3 will tell us whether each output is sufficiently constrained.
We are also interested in finding a way to return the part of the domain for each unconstrained output that
is not covered.
\egm{OK. Interesting. So if the ensures form a tautalogy then the output is constrained under every input? How do the pre-conditions factor in? It would have to be a tautology under the pre-condition constraints. Right? How is that logically stated?}

\subsection*{Detecting redundancy}

Redundancy also draws from Barnat's work. Given a contract \(\Phi = \{\varphi_{1}, \varphi_{2}, ..., \varphi_{n}\}\),
\(\varphi_{1}\) is not a redundant formula if \(\{\not \varphi_{1} \land \varphi_{2} \land ... \land \varphi_{n}\}\)
is satisfiable, because \(\{\varphi_{2} \land ... \land \varphi_{n}\} \not\implies \varphi_{1}\). So, we can check
each formula to see if it is redundant with respect to the rest of the formulae.
\egm{Look at logic minimization in the context of SMT. That would be really interesting. Construct the requires as a boolean predicate and then send that to the logic minimizer and reify it back into the original predicates.}

\section{Deliverables}

The main deliverable of this work will be a set of methods that use an SMT solver to determine the quality of software
contracts. The thesis will provide algorithms, as well as the specifics of the implementation in Dafny in order to make
extensions of this work accessible in the future. These methods will be implemented for Dafny, but could easily be
applied to other specification-based languages. The tool we create will be an option in Dafny that a developer can
use to check their specifications of any given function or method. Any potential issues will be reported back to the
developer.

\section{Timeline}

All of the research and creation of deliverables will be completed during the months of May-August 2023. The writing of the thesis and defense will happen between September-December 2023.
